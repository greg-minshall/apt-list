* apt-list

apt-list is a small utility that gives me something like "fink list"
gave me when i ran [[http://finkproject.org/][fink]] on macosx, i.e., a summary listing of
available (via apt-get(8)) packages, with the one line description of
each package, with an indication of installed files ('i' if
up-to-date; 'I' if there is an upgrade available -- both in column 1).

apt-list requires both apt-cache(8) and apt(8).  (my sense is that the
latter is newer.)

someday there should be some argument parsing, probably to restrict
the output to show only installed and/or installed, need upgrading,
files, plus maybe a search term (though, for both of those, grep(1)
works fine).

caveats:

- there are various "half-installed" states i've never seen, and
  so i don't know how this will work for that.
- as you'll see in your output, apt(8) produces a warning that it its
  output format is likely not stable; if its output format changes,
  apt-list will likely break.

enjoy.
