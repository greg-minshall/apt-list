* various utilities i would like to have
** list packages with install *and* upgrade status

i had this in fink.

[[http://stackoverflow.com/a/10428825/1527747][use debian-tools deb822]].  but, i need to parse the sources list, or
all the files in /var/lib/apt/lists.  and, in what order?  how does one
parse the version number to know ordering of versions?
here is the [[https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Version][version spec]].

#+BEGIN_SRC python
  from debian import deb822

  # get processor type (i386, amd64, etc.)

  # now, for each i in /var/lib/apt/lists/*._${PROC}_Packages, build a
  # database of what the highest level of each package might be.

  # now, for each installed package, add installed version to the
  # database.  this can be retrieved from deb822 on
  # /var/lib/dpkg/status.

  # now, for each available package, add to the database.  (actually,
  # probably done with the _Packages step above.)

  # now, for each entry in the database, output the summary.
#+END_SRC

or, i could just do a tool that would output the highest available
version for each /var/lib/apt/lists/*_${PROC}_Packages, and then diff
with output from 
: dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Package} ${Version}'

that might make more sense.  actually,
: apt list
sort of does this
: apt list 2>&1 | fgrep '[upgrad' | less
gives the upgradable packages
: apt list 2>&1 | fgrep '[' | less
gives all installed packages (upgradable or not)
: apt list 2>&1 | fgrep -v '[' | less
gives all uninstalled packages

so,
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
  # module subprocess: http://stackoverflow.com/a/89243/1527747
  import subprocess

  # run
  # dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Package} ${Version} ${Description}\n' | grep -v '^ '

  dq = subprocess.Popen(["dpkg-query", "-W", "--showformat='${Package} ${Version} ${Description}\n'"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
  gr = subprocess.Popen(["grep", "-v", "'^ '"], stdin=dq.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

  # build a database of the output

  for line in gr.stdout:
      print line


  # run
  # apt list 2>&1 | sed 'sX/[^ ]*XXg'

  al = subprocess.Popen(["apt", "list"], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)
  se = subprocess.Popen(["sed", "'sX/[^ ]*XXg'"],
                        stdin=al.stdout, stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

  # update the database with 1) install status ('[' exists in $4); 2)
  # upgradeable ($2 here doesn't match $2 in dpkg-query)

  for line in se.stdout:
      print line
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

''busybox-initramfs 1:1.22.0-15ubuntu1 Standalone shell setup for initramfs

 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single

 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common

 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,

 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than

 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included

 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU

 counterparts.

 DocBook is an SGML document type definition (DTD) that is well-suited

 to books, articles, or reference documentation about technical

 matters, systems, or software (although it is by no means limited to

 these applications).  It has emerged as an open and standard DTD in the

 software industry, and is used as the documentation system of choice

 for many free software projects.

 .

 This package contains the SGML DTD for DocBook, which describes

 the formal structure for documents following this format.  If you

 wish to author DocBook documents using XML rather than SGML, use the

 'docbook-xml' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit

 (psgml), validate (opensp) or format (docbook-xsl, docbook-dsssl)

 DocBook documents.

 .

 This package includes the 2.4.1, 3.0, 3.1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4 and

 4.5 versions of the DocBook SGML DTD.

''docbook-dsssl 1.79-9 modular DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, for print and HTML

 This package provides DSSSL stylesheets which let you convert DocBook

 SGML or XML files to various formats.

 .

 This package contains two DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, one for "print"

 output and one for HTML.  The print stylesheet can be used in

 conjunction with the RTF and the TeX back-ends that (Open)Jade

 provides to produce output suitable for printing.  The HTML

 stylesheet can be used to convert DocBook documents into HTML.

 .

 The stylesheets are modular in design so that you can extend and

 customize them.

 .

 Note that you can also perform DocBook XML styling using the

 "docbook-xsl" package, which provides the XSL stylesheets.  The XSL

 stylesheets are more actively maintained and contain more new

 features than these DSSSL stylesheets.

''docbook-to-man 1:2.0.0-34 converter from DocBook SGML into roff man macros

 docbook-to-man is a batch converter that transforms UNIX-style manpages from

 the DocBook SGML format into nroff/troff man macros.

 .

 This is not the original version by Fred Dalrymple, but one with the

 docbook-to-man lacks support for internationalization and utf-8. Other

 tools like docbook2man or docbook-xml with xsltproc are better suited for

 new projects.

''docbook-xml 4.5-7.3 standard XML documentation system for software and systems

 DocBook is an XML document type definition (DTD).  That is, it

 contains the "DocBook" document structure.  This is used by authors

 or editors writing documents in the DocBook XML format.  DocBook was

 designed for books, articles, or reference documentation about

 technical matters or software.  It has emerged as an open, standard

 DTD in the software industry, and is the documentation system of

 choice for many free software projects.

 .

 This package contains the XML DTD for DocBook, which describes the

 formal structure for documents following this format.  If you wish to

 author DocBook documents using SGML rather than XML, use the

 'docbook' package.  You will need other packages in order to edit

 (psgml), validate (opensp, libxml2-utils) or format (docbook-xsl,

 docbook-dsssl) DocBook documents.

 .

 This package ships with the latest DocBook 4.5 XML DTD, as well as a

 selected set of legacy DTDs for use with older documents, including

 4.0, 4.1.2, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4.

''docbook-xsl 1.79.1+dfsg-1 stylesheets for processing DocBook XML to various output formats

 These are modular XSL stylesheets for processing documents composed

 with the DocBook XML DTD and its derivatives ("Simplified" DocBook

 XML, JRefEntry DTD, etc.).

 .

 The stylesheets provide XSLT transformations for (X)HTML, WordML, HTML Help,

 JavaHelp, Man page (nroff), Website, Eclipse Platform Help file and XSL

 Formatting Object (XSL-FO) output. The latter can be further processed to

 a number of print formats using FOP or TeX-based tools.

 .

 The stylesheets are modular in the sense that you can extend and, to some

 extent, customize them. The documentation is included in a separate package.

 and its relatives.  It is intended to produce anti-aliased

 screen-resolution images as fast as is possible.  This makes

 dvipng suitable for generating large amounts of images

 on-the-fly.

 .

 dvipng does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX

 finishes.  It can read options interactively through stdin,

 and all options are usable. One can even change the input file through

 this interface.

 .

 dvipng supports PK, VF, PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, color

''dwm 6.0-8 dynamic window manager

 dwm is a minimalistic window manager. It manages windows in tiling and floating

 modes. Either mode can be applied dynamically, depending on the application in

 use and the task performed.

 .

 In tiling mode windows are managed in a master and stacking column. The master

 column contains the window which needs most attention at a time, whereas the

 stacking column contains all other windows in a stack. Dialog windows are

 managed floating, however.

 .

 In floating mode windows can be resized and moved freely. Windows are grouped

 by tags. All windows with a specific tag can be viewed at a time. But each

 window may contain more than one tag, which makes it visible in several views.

 .

 Please notice that dwm is currently customized through editing its source code,

 so you probably want to build your own dwm packages. This package is compiled

 with the default configuration and should just give you an idea about what dwm

 brings to your desktop.

''fonts-gfs-artemisia 1.1-5 greek font (Times Greek-like)

 The type family GFS Artemisia was designed by the painter-engraver

 Takis Katsoulidis and reflects his style and typographic acumen. It

 is largely his effort to offer, from a different perspective, a type

 face which, like Times Greek, would be applicable to a wide spectrum

 of uses and equally agreeable and legible. The typeface has been

 digitised by George D. Matthiopoulos.

 accompanied by a matching latin alphabet based on Hermann Zapf's Palatino.

''fonts-gfs-neohellenic 1.1-6 modern Greek font family with matching Latin

 Neohellenic is a Greek font family characterized by round, even pen

 strokes. It consists of several weights (normal, italic, bold, and

 bold italic) as well as a Latin version.

 .

 Former Greek types had harked back to classical models. In 1927,

 Victor Scholderer chose instead to revive one which had first

 appeared in a 1492 printing of Macrobius attributed to Joannes

 Rubeus. In 1993-4 the typeface was digitized by the Greek Font

 Society, with the addition of a new set of epigraphic symbols.

''fonts-gfs-olga 1.1-5 ancient Greek oblique font revival (companion to GFS Didot)

 In Greece the terms italic and oblique have the same meaning since

 they are borrowed from the latin typographic practice without any

 real historical equivalent in Greek history. Until the end of the

 19th century Greek typefaces were cut and cast independently, not as

 members of a typefamily. The mechanisation of typecutting allowed the

 transformation of upright Greek typefaces to oblique designs.

 Nonetheless, the typesetting practice of a cursive Greek font to

 complement an upright one did not survive the 19th century. The

 experimental font GFS Olga (1995) attempts to revive this lost

 tradition. The typeface was designed and digitised by George

 Matthiopoulos, based on the historical Porson Greek type (1803) with

 the intention to be the companion of the upright GFS Didot font

 whenever there is a need for an italic alternative.

''fonts-gfs-solomos 1.1-5 ancient Greek oblique font

 From the middle of the 19th century an italic font with many

 calligraphic overtones was introduced into Greek printing. Its source

 is unknown, but it almost certainly was the product of a German or

 Italian foundry. In the first type specimen printed in Greece by the

 typecutter K. Miliadis (1850), the font was listed anonymously along

 others of 11pts and in the Gr. Doumas' undated specimen appeared as

 «11pt Greek inclined». For most of the second half of the century the

 type was used extensively as an italic for emphasis in words,

 sentences or excerpts. In 1889, the folio size Type Specimen of

 Anestis Konstantinidis' publishing, printing and type founding

 establishment also included the type as «Greek inclined [9 & 12 pt]».

 .

 Nevertheless, the excessively calligraphic style of the characters,

 combined with the steep and uncomfortable obliqueness of the

 capitals, was out of favour in the 20th century and the type did not

 survive the conformity of the mechanical type cutting and casting.

 The font has been digitally revived, as part of our typographic

 tradition, by George D.  Matthiopoulos and is part of GFS' type

 library under the name GFS Solomos, in commemoration of the great

 Greek poet of the 19th century, Dionisios Solomos.

 Gentium Basic and Gentium Book Basic are font families based on the original

 Gentium design, but with additional weights. The "Book" family is slightly

 heavier. Both families come with a complete regular, bold, italic and bold

 italic set of fonts.

 .

 The supported character set, however, is much smaller than for the main

 Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts support only the Basic Latin and Latin-1

 Supplement Unicode ranges, plus a selection of the more commonly used extended

 Latin characters, with miscellaneous diacritical marks, symbols and

 punctuation. A much more complete character set will be supported in a future

 version of the complete Gentium fonts. These "Basic" fonts are intended as a

 way to provide additional weights for basic font users without waiting until

 the complete Gentium character set is finished.

 the main Gentium family:

  * Bold

  * Bold Italic

  * The slightly-heavier Book family

  * OpenType and Graphite smart code for diacritic placement

  * A few useful OpenType and Graphite features

  * Support for a few more recent additions to Unicode

  * Character assignments updated to Unicode 5.1

 Cyrillic-based writing system, whether used for phonetic or orthographic

 needs, and provide a matching Greek face. In addition, there is provision for

 other characters and symbols useful to linguists. This font makes use of

 state-of-the-art font technologies to support complex typographic issues, such

 as the need to position arbitrary combinations of base glyphs and diacritics

 optimally.

''grep 2.25-1~16.04.1 GNU grep, egrep and fgrep

 'grep' is a utility to search for text in files; it can be used from the

 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages

 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper

 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being

 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to

 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster

 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing

 will run more slowly, however.)

 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.

 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in

 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".

 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where

 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler

 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through

 locking.

''libboost-chrono-dev 1.58.0.1ubuntu1 C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks (default version)

 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 .

 The Boost.Chrono library provides:

 .

  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic

 duration class . Examples of time durations include days, minutes,

 seconds and nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number

 of clock ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are

 united with a generic interface by the duration facility.

  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point

 represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves

 epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.

  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a

 particular platform: system_clock, steady_clock and

 high_resolution_clock. A clock is a pairing of a time_point and

 duration, and a function which returns a time_point representing now.

 .

 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono

 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the

 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall

 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:

 .

  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the

 current process.

  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time

 spent by the current process.

  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures

 system-CPU time spent by the current process.

  * A tuple-like class

 process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU, and system-CPU

 process times together.

  * A thread_clock thread steady clock giving

 the time spent by the current thread (when supported by a platform).

 .

 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and

 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

 .

 This package is a dependency package, which depends on Debian's default

 Boost version (currently 1.58).

 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.

 .

 The Boost Python Library is used to quickly and easily export a C++

 library to Python such that the Python interface is very similar to

 the C++ interface. It is designed to be minimally intrusive on your

 C++ design. In most cases, you should not have to alter your C++

 classes in any way in order to use them with Boost.Python.  The

 system should simply "reflect" your C++ classes and functions into

 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:

 Subclassing extension types in Python, Overriding virtual functions

 in Python, Member function Overloading, Automatic wrapping of

 numeric operators among others.

 .

 This package also contains the pyste Boost.Python code generator that

 allows the user to specify classes and functions to be exported using

 a simple interface file, which following the Boost.Python's

 philosophy, is simple Python code.

 Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.

 What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel

 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing

 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be

 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b

 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings

 for headphone listening.

''libencode-locale-perl 1.05-1 utility to determine the locale encoding

 In many applications it's wise to let Perl use Unicode for the strings it

 processes. Most of the interfaces Perl has to the outside world are still byte

 based. Programs therefore need to decode byte strings that enter the program

 from the outside and encode them again on the way out.

 .

 The POSIX locale system is used to specify both the language conventions

 requested by the user and the preferred character set to consume and output.

 The Encode::Locale module looks up the charset and encoding (called a CODESET

 in the locale jargon) and arranges for the Encode module to know this encoding

 under the name "locale". It means bytes obtained from the environment can be

 converted to Unicode strings by calling Encode::encode(locale => $bytes) and

 converted back again with Encode::decode(locale => $string).

''libgsm1 1.0.13-4 Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor

 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an

 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for

 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP

 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.

 .

 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling

 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility

 with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160

 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).

 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker

 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable

 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

 .

 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and

 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime

 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the

 ETSI standard test patterns.

 The LiquidRescale (lqr) library provides a C/C++ API for performing

 non-uniform resizing of images by the seam-carving technique.

 .

 The library takes images in plain array format as input and converts

 them to a multi-size representation.

 .

 Following is a list of features:

 .

   * Areas in the image can be marked for preservation or discard

   * Once the image has been fully processed, the scaling can be done

     in real-time. In fact, the information can be saved and read out

     later without any further processing

   * The resizing is done with a single function which automatically

     performs all the necessary operations; it can also work in

     successive steps without wasting computational time

   * Possibility to tune the carving operation by letting the seams be

     less connected, or more rigid, or both

   * Can export and import the visibility map (the seams)

   * Other images can be attached and undergo the same carving process

     as the parent image

   * The automatic feature detection algorithm can be tuned by

     selecting among different energy gradient functions

   * Reports progress through a customizable interface

   * A signalling system permits to cleanly handle errors

 .

''liblwp-protocol-https-perl 6.06-2 HTTPS driver for LWP::UserAgent

 The LWP::Protocol::https module provides support for using HTTPS schemed URLs

 with LWP. LWP::Protocol::https is a plug-in to the LWP protocol handling, so

 you don't use it directly. Once the module is installed LWP is able to access

 sites using HTTP over SSL/TLS.

 If hostname verification is requested by LWP::UserAgent's ssl_opts, and

 neither SSL_ca_file nor SSL_ca_path is set, then SSL_ca_file is implied to be

 the one provided by ca-certificates.

 This module used to be bundled with libwww-perl, but it was unbundled in

 v6.02 in order to be able to declare its dependencies properly for the CPAN

 tool-chain. Applications that need HTTPS support can just declare their

 dependency on LWP::Protocol::https and will no longer need to know what

 underlying modules to install.

 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and

 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the

 cutting edge.

 .

 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing

 and sample format conversion operations.

 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:

  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a

    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low

    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms

    are available.

  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from

    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output

    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors

    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)

    are enabled through dedicated options.

  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for

    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.

    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all

    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to

    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a

    dedicated buffer or "plane").

 format conversion operations.

 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:

  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling

    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.

  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and

    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.

    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout

    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),

    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a

    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the

''libxml-libxml-perl 2.0123+dfsg-1build1 Perl interface to the libxml2 library

 XML::LibXML is a Perl interface to the GNOME libxml2 library, which provides

 interfaces for parsing and manipulating XML files. This module allows Perl

 programmers to make use of the highly capable validating XML parser and the

 high performance Document Object Model (DOM) implementation. Additionally, it

 supports using the XML Path Language (XPath) to find and extract information.

''libxml-namespacesupport-perl 1.11-1 Perl module for supporting simple generic namespaces

 XML::NamespaceSupport offers a simple way to process namespace-based XML

 names. It also helps maintain a prefix-to-namespace URI map and provides a

 number of basic checks.

''libxml-parser-perl 2.44-1build1 Perl module for parsing XML files

 The XML::Parser module provides ways to parse XML documents.  It is built on

 top of XML::Parser::Expat, which is a lower level interface to James Clark's

 expat library. Each call to one of the parsing methods creates a new instance

 of XML::Parser::Expat which is then used to parse the document. Expat options

 may be provided when the XML::Parser object is created. These options are

 then passed on to the Expat object on each parse call. They can also be given

 as extra arguments to the parse methods, in which case they override options

 given at XML::Parser creation time.

 .

 The behavior of the parser is controlled either by Style and/or Handlers

 options, or by setHandlers method. These all provide mechanisms for

 XML::Parser to set the handlers needed by XML::Parser::Expat. If neither

 Style nor Handlers are specified, then parsing just checks the document for

 being well-formed.

 .

 When underlying handlers get called, they receive as their first parameter

 the Expat object, not the Parser object.

''libxml-sax-base-perl 1.07-1 base class for SAX drivers and filters

 XML::SAX::Base is a base class for PerlSAX drivers and filters.  The main

 advantages that it provides are easy dispatching of events the right way (ie

 it takes care for you of checking that the handler has implemented that

 method, or has defined an AUTOLOAD), and the guarantee that filters will pass

 along events that they aren't implementing to handlers downstream that might

 nevertheless be interested in them.

 .

 This package also provides XML::SAX::Exception.

''libxml-sax-expat-perl 0.40-2 Perl module for a SAX2 driver for Expat (XML::Parser)

 This module is an implementation of a SAX2 driver sitting on top of

 Expat (XML::Parser).  It is still incomplete, though most of the

 basic SAX2 events should be available.

''libxml-sax-perl 0.99+dfsg-2ubuntu1 Perl module for using and building Perl SAX2 XML processors

 XML::SAX consists of several framework classes for using and

 building Perl SAX2 XML parsers, filters, and drivers.  It is designed

 around the need to be able to "plug in" different SAX parsers to an

 application without requiring programmer intervention.  Those of you

 familiar with the DBI will be right at home.  Some of the designs

 come from the Java JAXP specification (SAX part), only without the

 javaness.

 .

 The package also contains a SAX parser, XML::SAX::PurePerl, but it

 is considered too slow for serious use and is only provided as a

 fallback parser. It is recommend XML::SAX::Expat (provided in

 libxml-sax-expat-perl) instead.

 .

 The framework includes a Debian-specific script (called

 update-perl-sax-parsers) to manage the ParserDetails.ini file. This

 script is intended to be used in postinst and prerm package scripts to

 (de)register parsers.  See README.Debian for more info.

''libxml-twig-perl 1:3.48-1 Perl module for processing huge XML documents in tree mode

 This module provides a way to process XML documents.  It is built on

 top of XML::Parser.

 .

 The module offers a tree interface to the document, while allowing to

 output the parts of it that have been completely processed.

 .

 It allows minimal resource (CPU and memory) usage by building the

 tree only for the parts of the documents that need actual processing,

 through the use of the twig_roots and twig_print_outside_roots

 options.  The finish and finish_print methods also help to increase

 performance.

 .

 XML::Twig tries to make simple things easy so it tries its best to

 takes care of a lot of the (usually) annoying (but sometimes

 necessary) features that come with XML and XML::Parser.

''mlocate 0.26-1ubuntu2 quickly find files on the filesystem based on their name

 mlocate is a new implementation of locate, a tool to find files

 anywhere in the filesystem based on their name, using a fixed pattern

 or a regular expression. Unlike other tools like find(1), locate uses

 a previously created database to perform the search, allowing queries

 to execute much faster. This database is updated periodically from

 cron.

 .

 Several implementations of locate exist: the original implementation

 from GNU's findutils, slocate, and mlocate. The advantages of mlocate

 are:

 .

  * it indexes all the filesystem, but results of a search will only

    include files that the user running locate has access to. It does

    this by updating the database as root, but making it unreadable for

    normal users, who can only access it via the locate binary. slocate

    does this as well, but not the original locate.

 .

  * instead of re-reading all the contents of all directories each time

    the database is updated, mlocate keeps timestamp information in its

    database and can know if the contents of a directory changed without

    reading them again. This makes updates much faster and less demanding

    on the hard drive. This feature is only found in mlocate.

 .

 Installing mlocate will change the /usr/bin/locate binary to point to

 mlocate via the alternatives mechanism. After installation, you may

 wish to run /etc/cron.daily/mlocate by hand to create the database,

 otherwise mlocate won't work until that script is run from cron itself

 (since mlocate does not use the same database file as standard locate).

 Also, you may wish to remove the "locate" package in order not to have

 two different database files updated regularly on your system.

''parted 3.2-15 disk partition manipulator

 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,

 move, and copy disk partitions. This is useful for creating space

 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data

 to new hard disks.

 .

 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further

 documentation is available in parted-doc.

 .

 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98

 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which

 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,

 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS

 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file

 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system

 operations is now deprecated.

 .

 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive

 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they

 could exist, so please back up all important files before running

 it, and do so at your own risk.

''pax 1:20151013-1 Portable Archive Interchange (cpio, pax, tar)

 paxtar is an implementation of an archiving utility that reads

 and writes several formats - traditional ones, the extended

 formats specified in IEEE 1003.1, and the ar(5) format used

 by deb(5) packages (MirBSD specific paxtar extension). The

 pax interface was designed by IEEE 1003.2 as a compromise in

 the chronic controversy over which of tar or cpio is best, but

 this implementation offers paxcpio and paxtar for easy calling.

 .

 This is the MirBSD paxtar implementation supporting the formats

 ar, bcpio, cpio, SVR4 cpio with and without CRC, old tar, and

 ustar, but not the format known as pax yet. It has extensions

 for removing non-numerical user and group IDs from the archive,

 storing hardlinked files only once, setting ownership to the

 superuser, anonymising inode and device information, changing

 the mtime to zero, and producing GNU tar compatible trailing

 slashes on ustar directory nodes. Its "ar" format is suitable

 for operating on *.deb files, unlike that of GNU binutils.

 .

 Note that ACLs and Extended Attributes are not supported.

 Also, on Debian GNU/Hurd and Debian GNU/Linux (but not

 Debian GNU/kFreeBSD), size of archive members is limited

 to the width of the "long" type, that is, 2 GiB on platforms

 that do not have a 64-bit "long" type, due to a bug in the

 GNU C library (Debian #317466).

''python-cherrypy3 3.5.0-2build1 Python web development framework - version 3

 CherryPy is a pythonic, object-oriented web development framework. It

 provides the foundation over which complex web-based applications can

 be written, with little or no knowledge of the underlying

 protocols. CherryPy allows developers to build web applications in

 much the same way they would build any other object-oriented Python

 program. This usually results in smaller source code developed in

 less time.

 .

 CherryPy is up-to-date with the latest developments on using Python

 for web development: it features a bundled WSGI server, and is able

 to integrate with other dispatching mechanisms, such as

 Routes. CherryPy can be run as a standalone application, since it

 provides its own HTTP server; setting it up behind another HTTP

 server, such as Apache, or even with mod_python are also options.

 .

 This version is backwards incompatible with the 2.2 version in some

 ways. See http://www.cherrypy.org/wiki/UpgradeTo30.

 structured.

    * decorators help reduce boilerplate code;

    * decorators help the separation of concerns;

    * decorators enhance readability and maintainability;

    * decorators are very explicit.

''python-hachoir-core 1.3.3-4 Core of Hachoir framework: parse and edit binary files

 Hachoir is a Python library used to represent of a binary file as a tree of

 Python objects. Each object has a type, a value, an address, etc. The goal is

 to be able to know the meaning of each bit in a file.

 .

 Why using slow Python code instead of fast hardcoded C code? Hachoir has many

 interesting features:

  * Autofix: Hachoir is able to open invalid / truncated files

  * Lazy: Open a file is very fast since no information is read from file,

    data are read and/or computed when the user ask for it

  * Types: Hachoir has many predefined field types (integer, bit, string, etc.)

    and supports string with charset (ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, UTF-16, ...)

  * Addresses and sizes are stored in bit, so flags are stored as classic fields

  * Endian: You have to set endian once, and then number are converted in the

    right endian

  * Editor: Using Hachoir representation of data, you can edit, insert, remove

    data and then save in a new file.

''python-hachoir-metadata 1.3.3-2 Program to extract metadata using Hachoir library

 hachoir-metadata extracts metadata from multimedia files: music, picture,

 video, but also archives. It supports most common file formats:

  * Archives: bzip2, gzip, zip, tar

  * Audio: MPEG audio ("MP3"), WAV, Sun/NeXT audio, Ogg/Vorbis (OGG), MIDI,

    AIFF, AIFC, Real audio (RA)

  * Image: BMP, CUR, EMF, ICO, GIF, JPEG, PCX, PNG, TGA, TIFF, WMF, XCF

  * Video: ASF format (WMV video), AVI, Matroska (MKV), Quicktime (MOV),

    Ogg/Theora, Real media (RM)

 .

 It tries to give as much information as possible. For some file formats,

 it gives really more information than libextractor for example. RIFF parser

 is really good for example, it can extract creation date, software used to

 generate the file, etc. But hachoir-metadata can not guess information. The

 most complex operation is just to compute duration of a music using frame size

 and file size.

 .

 hachoir-metadata has three modes:

  * classic mode: extract metadata, you can use --level=LEVEL to limit quantity

    of information to display (and not to extract)

  * --type: show on one line the file format and most important information

  * --mime: just display file MIME type

 .

 The command 'hachoir-metadata --mime' works like 'file --mime',

 and 'hachoir-metadata --type' like 'file'. But today file command supports

 more file formats then hachoir-metadata.

''python-hachoir-parser 1.3.4-2 Package of Hachoir parsers used to open binary files

 hachoir-parser is a package of most common file format parsers written for

 Hachoir framework. Not all parsers are complete, some are very good and other

 know *each* bit meaning. Some good (but not perfect ;-)) parsers:

  * Matroska video

  * Microsoft RIFF (AVI video, WAV audio, CDA file)

  * PNG picture

  * TAR and ZIP archive

''python-pysqlite2 2.7.0-1 Python interface to SQLite 3

 pysqlite is a DB-API 2.0-compliant database interface for SQLite.

 .

 This package is built against SQLite 3. For an interface to SQLite 2,

 see the package python-sqlite. An alternative Python SQLite 3 module

 is packaged as python-apsw.

 .

 SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a

 relatively small C library. It is a public domain project created

 by D. Richard Hipp. Unlike the usual client-server paradigm, the

 SQLite engine is not a standalone process with which the program

 communicates, but is linked in and thus becomes an integral part

 of the program. The library implements most of SQL-92 standard,

 including transactions, triggers and most of complex queries.

 .

 pysqlite makes this powerful embedded SQL engine available to

 Python programmers. It stays compatible with the Python database

 API specification 2.0 as much as possible, but also exposes most

 of SQLite's native API, so that it is for example possible to

 create user-defined SQL functions and aggregates in Python.

 .

 If you need a relational database for your applications, or even

 small tools or helper scripts, pysqlite is often a good fit. It's

 easy to use, easy to deploy, and does not depend on any other

 Python libraries or platform libraries, except SQLite. SQLite

 itself is ported to most platforms you'd ever care about.

 .

 It's often a good alternative to MySQL, the Microsoft JET engine

 or the MSDE, without having any of their license and deployment

 issues.

 QPDF understands PDF files that use compressed object streams

 (supported by newer PDF applications) and can convert such files into

 those that can be read with older viewers.  It can also be used for

 checking PDF files for structural errors, inspecting stream contents,

 or extracting objects from PDF files.  QPDF is not PDF content

 creation or viewing software -- it does not have the capability to

 create PDF files from scratch or to display PDF files.

''r-base 3.2.3-4 GNU R statistical computation and graphics system

 R is a system for statistical computation and graphics.  It consists

 of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger,

 access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs

 stored in script files.

 .

 The design of R has been heavily influenced by two existing languages:

 Becker, Chambers & Wilks' S and Sussman's Scheme.  Whereas the

 resulting language is very similar in appearance to S, the underlying

 implementation and semantics are derived from Scheme.

 .

 The core of R is an interpreted computer language which allows

 branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions.

 Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R.  It is

 possible for the user to interface to procedures written in the

 C, C++, or FORTRAN languages for efficiency, and many of R's core

 functions do so.  The R distribution contains functionality for a

 large number of statistical procedures and underlying applied math

 computations.  There is also a large set of functions which provide

 a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data

 presentations.

 .

 Additionally, several thousand extension "packages" are available from

 CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network, many also as Debian packages,

 named 'r-cran-<name>'.

 .

 This package is a metapackage which eases the transition from the

 pre-1.5.0 package setup with its larger r-base package. Once installed, it

''telnet 0.17-40 basic telnet client

 The telnet command is used for interactive communication with another host

 using the TELNET protocol.

 .

 For the purpose of remote login, the present client executable should be

 depreciated in favour of an ssh-client, or in some cases with variants like

 telnet-ssl or Kerberized TELNET clients.  The most important reason is that

 this implementation exchanges user name and password in clear text.

 .

 On the other hand, the present program does satisfy common use cases of

 network diagnostics, like protocol testing of SMTP services, so it can

 become handy enough.

''ucf 3.0036 Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files

 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be

 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior

 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg

 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as

 needed.

 .

 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default

 version that will work for most installations, although some system

 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the

 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must

 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at

 any other time).

 .

 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that

 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,

 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to

 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general

 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally

 provides for 'conffiles'.

 .

 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a

 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come

 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at

 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the

 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to

 conffile status.

 .

 This package is built from the X.org xf86-video-vmware driver module.

''xsltproc 1.1.28-2.1 XSLT 1.0 command line processor

 XSLT is an XML language for defining transformations of XML files from

 XML to some other arbitrary format, such as XML, HTML, plain text, etc.

 using standard XSLT version 1.0 stylesheets.

 .

 This package contains a command line tool that facilitates XSLT

 transformations.

''xterm 322-1ubuntu1 X terminal emulator

 xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System.  It provides DEC VT102

 and Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the

 window system directly.  This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of

 the control sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.

 .

 This package provides four commands: xterm, which is the traditional

 terminal emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is

 intelligent about locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8

 character encoding), but which requires the luit program from the x11-utils

 package; koi8rxterm, a wrapper similar to uxterm for locales that use the

 KOI8-R character set; and lxterm, a simple wrapper that chooses which of the

 previous commands to execute based on the user's locale settings.

 .

 A complete list of control sequences supported by the X terminal emulator

 is provided in /usr/share/doc/xterm.

 .

 The xterm program uses bitmap images provided by the xbitmaps package.

 .

 Those interested in using koi8rxterm will likely want to install the

 xfonts-cyrillic package as well.

''xtrans-dev 1.3.5-1 X transport library (development files)

 xtrans includes a number of routines to make X implementations

 transport-independent; at time of writing, it includes support for UNIX

 sockets, IPv4, IPv6, and DECnet.

 .

 xtrans is not actually a library in itself; it includes .c files which are

 then used in the compilation of X servers, libraries, et al.

 .

  * Add a "Report a bug" entry to the Help menu

  * Set homepage to Ubuntu Start Page

  * Display a restart notification after upgrading Firefox

''xutils-dev 1:7.7+3ubuntu2 X Window System utility programs for development

 xutils-dev provides a set of utility programs shipped with the X Window System

 that do not require the X libraries; many of these programs are useful

 even on a system that does not have any X clients or X servers installed.

 .

 The programs in this package include:

  - imake, a C preprocessor interface to the make utility;

  - lndir, a tool that creates a shadow directory of symbolic links to

    another directory tree;

  - makedepend, a tool to create dependencies in makefiles;

  - makeg, a tool for making debuggable executables.

 .

 This package also contains xorg-macros.m4, a set of macros used in configure

 scripts of X.Org packages.

''xvt 2.1-20.1ubuntu1 X terminal-emulator similar to xterm, but smaller

 xvt is an X terminal-emulator that is designed to be more or less

 compatible with xterm while using much less swap space.  It is mainly

 intended for use at sites which use large numbers of X terminals but

 may also be useful on single workstations that are short of memory.

 The main way that xvt achieves its small size is by avoiding the use

 of the X toolkit.

 .

 If you are looking for a more featureful terminal-emulator than xvt,

 but one which still uses less swap space than xterm, consider rxvt.

 .

 Features of xterm which xvt does not support include:

 .

  - Tektronix 4014 emulation

  - Session logging

  - Pop-up menus.  The only one of xterm's popup menu commands that

    is provided in xvt is displaying and hiding of the scrollbar

    and this is done simply by pressing any mouse key in the window

    with the CONTROL key held down.

  - Toolkit style configurability.  In particular, xvt does not

    allow the user to remap the mouse or keyboard keys.

 .

 Features which are supported include:

 .

  - VT100 emulation.  Most of the main escape sequences are supported --

    certainly all those used by the standard screen based UNIX

    applications.

  - Lines that scroll off the top of the window are saved and can be

    scrolled back with a scrollbar.

  - Text selection and insertion including double and triple click for

    words and lines.

''xz-utils 5.1.1alpha+20120614-2ubuntu2 XZ-format compression utilities

 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm

 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful

 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.

 .

 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ

 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can

 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate

 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma

 package.

 .

 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some

 improvements for general use:

 .

  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;

  * crc64 data integrity check;

  * limited random-access reading support;

  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);

  * support for flushing the encoder.

''zip 3.0-11 Archiver for .zip files

 This is InfoZIP's zip program. It produces files that are fully

 compatible with the popular PKZIP program; however, the command line

 options are not identical. In other words, the end result is the same,

 but the methods differ. :-)

 .

 This version supports encryption.
